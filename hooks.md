This is a collection of hooks that we can reuse for any project that needs them. It's also a source of use cases of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) and how to test them using [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @iteam/hooks
```
